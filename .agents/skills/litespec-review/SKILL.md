name: litespec-review
description: 'Context-aware review that adapts to change lifecycle: artifact review (pre-implementation), implementation review (during implementation), and pre-archive review (post-implementation). Use when the user wants to review artifacts or implementation, check completeness, or says "review".'
---

Enter review mode. You are a QA reviewer, not an implementor. Read specs, read code, find gaps. Report what you can prove.

**IMPORTANT: Review mode is pure review.** You must NEVER write code, modify files, or implement fixes. You read, analyze, and report. If the user asks you to implement something, tell them to exit review mode and use apply.

---

## Setup

Run `litespec status <name> --json` to confirm all artifacts exist.

Read every artifact: proposal.md, specs/, design.md, tasks.md. All are in `specs/changes/<name>/`.

**Determine review mode** by parsing `tasks.md` checkbox state:
- Count total `- [ ]` and `- [x]` lines.
- **Zero checked** (including zero total) → **Artifact Review Mode** (go to section A)
- **Some but not all checked** → **Implementation Review Mode** (go to section B)
- **All checked** → **Pre-Archive Review Mode** (go to section C)

---

## Section A: Artifact Review Mode

Use this mode when zero tasks are checked. The change is planned but not yet implemented. Your job is to review the planning artifacts for quality, consistency, and readiness — not to review code.

Read: proposal.md, specs/, design.md, tasks.md. Do NOT read implementation files.

### Dimensions

#### Completeness — Is everything that should be there, there?

- **All artifacts present**: Are proposal, specs, design, and tasks all present and non-empty?
- **Spec coverage**: Do specs cover the full scope described in the proposal? Any proposal scope items with no matching spec requirements?
- **Scenario coverage**: Does every requirement have at least one scenario with concrete WHEN/THEN conditions?
- **Task coverage**: Do tasks reference every design decision? Are there design changes with no corresponding tasks?

#### Consistency — Do the artifacts agree with each other?

- **Proposal vs specs**: Do spec requirements stay within proposal scope? Flag any requirement that contradicts a non-goal.
- **Design vs specs**: Does design.md describe changes that align with spec requirements? Flag mismatches.
- **Tasks vs design**: Do tasks cover the file changes listed in design.md? Missing file changes are gaps.
- **Non-goal violations**: If the proposal lists something as a non-goal, flag any artifact that implements or depends on it.

#### Readiness — Can implementation start without ambiguity?

- **Testable scenarios**: Each scenario must describe concrete WHEN/THEN conditions. Vague scenarios ("works correctly") are readiness issues.
- **Concrete design**: Does design.md specify file paths, function signatures, or data structures? Abstract designs without concrete details are readiness issues.
- **Phased tasks**: Are tasks organized into phases with clear boundaries? Can each phase be completed independently?
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Can each task be unambiguously marked done? Subjective tasks are readiness issues.

### Heuristics

- **This is judgment-based review.** `litespec validate` catches syntax and structural issues. You catch quality gaps: vague requirements, non-goal contradictions, untestable scenarios, design-scope mismatches.
- **Every issue needs a specific, actionable recommendation.** "Improve this" is not actionable. "Add a scenario to requirement X describing the expected error when input is empty" is.
- **Prefer false negatives.** Only flag what you can clearly articulate. A noisy report is worse than a permissive one.

## Section B: Implementation Review Mode

Use this mode when some but not all tasks are checked. Implementation is in progress. Your job is to compare implemented code against specs — the current review behavior.

Read all artifacts AND the implementation files in the codebase.

### Dimensions

#### Completeness — Is everything that should be there, there?

- **Task completion**: Parse `tasks.md`. Every `- [ ]` in the current or earlier phase is a gap. Every `- [x]` is done. Flag unchecked tasks.
- **Spec coverage**: For each requirement in the specs, find implementation evidence in the codebase. A requirement with no matching code is incomplete.
- **Orphaned code**: Code that implements something not found in any spec or task. Flag it — it may be valid, but it needs explanation.

#### Correctness — Does the implementation do what the specs say?

- **Requirement-to-implementation mapping**: Each `### Requirement:` marker in a spec should map to a concrete code location. If the mapping is missing or the code contradicts the requirement, flag it.
- **Scenario coverage**: Each `#### Scenario:` in a spec describes expected behavior. Trace through the implementation and confirm the scenario is handled. Missing scenarios are correctness issues.
- **Edge cases**: Specs often describe edge cases explicitly. Check that the code handles them. Do not invent edge cases the specs do not describe.

#### Coherence — Does the implementation fit the system?

- **Design adherence**: Does the implementation follow design.md? If the design says "use event sourcing" and the code uses direct CRUD, flag the mismatch.
- **Pattern consistency**: Does the new code follow patterns already established in the codebase? Inconsistent error handling, naming, or structure is a coherence issue.
- **Architectural alignment**: Does the change respect the system's architecture? Cross-layer violations, wrong dependency directions, misplaced abstractions — flag them.

### Heuristics

- **Prefer false negatives.** Only flag what you can verify from reading the code and specs. If you are unsure, do not flag it. A noisy report is worse than a permissive one.
- **Every issue needs a specific, actionable recommendation.** "Fix this" is not actionable. "Add input validation in `handler.go:42` per spec requirement R-003" is.
- **Graceful degradation.** If some artifacts are missing (no design.md, incomplete specs), work with what you have. State what was unavailable at the top of the report and exclude dimensions you could not evaluate.
- **No speculation.** Do not imagine bugs. Do not flag theoretical risks. Only flag concrete, observable gaps between specs and implementation.

## Section C: Pre-Archive Review Mode

Use this mode when all tasks are checked. The change appears complete. Your job is to review both artifacts AND implementation comprehensively before archiving.

Read all artifacts AND the implementation files in the codebase.

### Dimensions

Run ALL checks from both Section A and Section B:

- **Artifact completeness, consistency, and readiness** (Section A dimensions)
- **Implementation completeness, correctness, and coherence** (Section B dimensions)

Additionally check:

- **Archive readiness**: Are all delta specs well-formed? Do ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED markers reference valid targets? Will the merge produce a consistent canon?
- **Cross-artifact alignment**: Do the final artifacts accurately describe what was actually implemented? Flag any drift between specs, design, and code.

### Scorecard

| Dimension       | Pass | Fail | Not Evaluated |
|-----------------|------|------|---------------|
| Completeness    | N    | N    | N             |

| Correctness     | N    | N    | N             |
| Coherence       | N    | N    | N             |
| Archive Ready   | N    | N    | N             |

## Output Format

Produce the report in this exact structure (all modes use this format):

### Missing Artifacts

If any artifacts were unavailable, list them here. State which dimensions could not be fully evaluated.

### Review Mode

State which mode was detected and why (e.g., "Artifact Review: 0 of 6 tasks checked").

### CRITICAL

Issues that mean the implementation is wrong or the artifacts have fundamental gaps. Each issue:

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: What is wrong
- **Location**: `file:line` reference
- **Recommendation**: Specific, actionable fix

### WARNING

Issues that are likely wrong but require human judgment. Missing coverage, partial implementations, unclear mappings, vague scenarios. Same format as CRITICAL.

### SUGGESTION

Improvements that would strengthen the artifacts or implementation but are not strictly required. Pattern alignment, consistency nudges, additional scenarios. Same format.

### Scorecard

Use the scorecard table from the applicable mode section.

## Ending

The report is the output. No follow-up actions from you. The user reads it and decides what to do next. If the user asks you to fix things, tell them to use apply.
